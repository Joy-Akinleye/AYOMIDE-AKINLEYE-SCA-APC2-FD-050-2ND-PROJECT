                        My Journey into Tech - website development specifically started in 2019, just right after
                        secondary
                        school.
                        I wanted to take a programming class at a Training center but the programming tutor didn't show
                        up
                        for 2
                        weeks and i decided to join the Website Development class where i was introduced to HTML & CSS.
                        It
                        turned
                        out to be fun but i didn't stay for long, hence no serious study/learning was done.

                        Fast forward to university days when i saw people making money from it and decided to re-study
                        it
                        and
                        make
                        it a profession but it was hard to combine with school work but i was trying bit by bit.

                        I started learning JavaScript in 2023, during my SIWES Training but it was more of theory and
                        JavaScript
                        is
                        a little bit tough so i gave up but here i am now at SHE CODE AFRICA, putting all myself and
                        brain
                        together
                        to get it right.
